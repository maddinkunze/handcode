TLDR (not legally binding): All code files outside src/lib/handwriting/* are licensed under MIT. The license of files within src/lib/handwriting/* is undefined. Releases and outputs of this program are strictly for non-commercial purposes only. 


Long version:
This project is based on the handwriting_synthesis project and includes modified sources from it. At the time of writing this note, no license is specified for the handwriting_synthesis project. However, the following assumptioms are made:
 - Based on the wording in the README of handwriting_synthesis, usage like this seems reasonable. If a license is specified later on, the same license will apply to parts of the code that are specified in the next part.
 - It is likely that the checkpoints included in the handwriting_synthesis project were trained on a dataset that only allows non-commercial use. As such the same non-commercial license will apply to all checkpoints and models derived from these checkpoints.

As such, the following restrictions apply:
1. All code files in this repository, except for files that apply to the the following restrictions, are licensed under the MIT License given in the LICENSE file
2.1. If the license of handwriting_synthesis turns out to be MIT, all code files within src/lib/handwriting/* will also be licensed under MIT license
2.2. If the license of handwriting_synthesis turns out to not be MIT, all code files within src/lib/handwriting/* will be licensed under the same license as handwriting_synthesis. 
2.3. If the license of handwriting_synthesis turns out to not be MIT, I hereby grant an alternative license (MIT) to all changes made by me to all code files within src/lib/handwriting/*. This includes files that were added (as opposed to changed) by me. 
3. All non-code files (i.e. checkpoints, models, styles, other binary formats) within src/lib/handwriting/* are distributed under the datasets license, that explicitly prohibits commercial use. 
4. All releases of this program are licensed under the same license as handwriting_synthesis. However, independently of the license of handwriting_synthesis, commercial use is explicitly prohibited. 
5. All outputs created by this program are strictly limited to non-commercial use.
6. Independently of the license of handwriting_synthesis, if the license of handwriting_synthesis is incompatible with the license of this program, any license agreement between you (the user) and me will be null and void, until both licenses are compatible again.
