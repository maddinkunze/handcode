### Attribution

This model runner is an unofficial port of https://caligrapher.ai/ which seems to be based off of https://github.com/sjvasquez/handwriting-synthesis (see the sjvasquez runner for another, more verbose implementation of this).

### Setup

You don't need any special setup to use this model. Running `uv sync` will download all relevant requirements (most notably `numpy`).

### License

The same license and restrictions as given for the sjvasquez runner apply.
