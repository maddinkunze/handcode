### Attribution

This model runner is a (in parts) heavily modified version of Sean Vasquez's [handwriting-synthesis](https://github.com/sjvasquez/handwriting-synthesis)

### License

The code itself does not contain any license. The wording in the README suggest, that usage like this seems reasonable.

As far as could be determined, the pretrained models/checkpoints of this model runner are trained on the [IAM On-Line Handwriting Database](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-on-line-handwriting-database), which strictly prohibits commercial use.
